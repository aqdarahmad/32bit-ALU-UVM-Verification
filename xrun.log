	Extracting FSMs for coverage:
		worklib.alu
	Total FSMs extracted = 0
	Building instance overlay tables: .................... Done
	Enabling instrumentation for coverage types: block expression FSM toggle functional
xmelab: *W,COVDCL: By default expression coverage is scored only for Verilog logical operators (|| and &&) and VHDL logical operators (OR, AND, NOR, and NAND), and is scored only in condition expressions. To score coverage for other operators and for expressions in other statements, use the "set_expr_coverable_operators" and "set_expr_coverable_statements" coverage configuration file commands with suitable options at elaboration.
